# Online Store Webpage 🛍️

Welcome to my Online Store Webpage! This project is developed using JavaScript and fetches product information from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). I've incorporated various features such as async functions, custom objects, and the dynamic rendering of elements to create a mockup online shop.

## How it Works 🤔
Our webpage fetches product data from the Fake Store API using JavaScript's async functions. Each product is represented by a custom object, allowing for structured and organized code.

## Custom Objects 🧩
We've defined custom objects to represent products, making the code modular and easy to maintain. Each product object includes properties such as `id`, `name`, `price`, and more.

## Async Functions ⏳
The use of async functions ensures a smooth user experience, especially when fetching data from external APIs. Asynchronous operations prevent the webpage from freezing during data retrieval.

## Responsive Design 📱
Our webpage is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
